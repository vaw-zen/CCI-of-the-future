# 🔧 GitHub Actions Workflow Path Fix Complete!

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

**Problem**: GitHub Actions workflow failed with error:
```
Error: Cannot find module '/home/runner/work/CCI-of-the-future/CCI-of-the-future/scripts/simple-seo-analysis.cjs'
```

**Root Cause**: When we cleaned up the repository to only track `scripts/workflows/`, we inadvertently removed essential files that the workflows depend on:
- `scripts/data/seo-keywords.csv` (SEO keyword database)
- `scripts/reports/` directory (workflow output location)

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

### 1. **Updated .gitignore to track essential directories:**
```ignore
# Scripts directory - only track workflows, data, and reports
scripts/*
!scripts/workflows/
!scripts/data/
!scripts/reports/
```

### 2. **Added back required files:**
- ✅ `scripts/data/seo-keywords.csv` - SEO keyword database (117 keywords)
- ✅ `scripts/reports/` - Workflow output directory (21 report files)
- ✅ All workflow scripts remain in organized `scripts/workflows/` structure

### 3. **Verified workflow paths are correct:**
```yaml
# ✅ All these paths are working correctly:
node scripts/workflows/seo-automation/simple-seo-analysis.cjs
node scripts/workflows/seo-automation/keyword-update.cjs
node scripts/workflows/seo-automation/performance-tracking.cjs
node scripts/workflows/email-automation/updated-email-automation.cjs
```
