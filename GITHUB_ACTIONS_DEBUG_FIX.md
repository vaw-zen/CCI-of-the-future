# 🐛 GitHub Actions Path Issue - Debug & Fix Applied

## ❌ **Error Encountered:**
```
Error: Cannot find module '/home/runner/work/CCI-of-the-future/CCI-of-the-future/scripts/simple-seo-analysis.cjs'
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis:**

The error showed that GitHub Actions was looking for `scripts/simple-seo-analysis.cjs` instead of the correct path `scripts/workflows/seo-automation/simple-seo-analysis.cjs`. This suggested two potential issues:

1. **Script Internal Path References**: The SEO automation scripts had hardcoded CSV paths that didn't account for the new folder structure
2. **Workflow Character Corruption**: Special characters (�) in the workflow file were potentially causing parsing issues

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied:**

### 1. **Fixed Script Internal Paths**
Updated all SEO automation scripts to use environment-aware paths:

**Before:**
```javascript
this.csvPath = 'seo-keywords.csv';  // ❌ Wrong for new structure
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Check if running in GitHub Actions or locally
const isGitHubActions = process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS === 'true';
this.csvPath = isGitHubActions ? 'scripts/data/seo-keywords.csv' : '../../data/seo-keywords.csv';
```

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `scripts/workflows/seo-automation/simple-seo-analysis.cjs`
- ✅ `scripts/workflows/seo-automation/seo-content-automation.cjs`
- ✅ `scripts/workflows/seo-automation/keyword-update.cjs`
- ✅ `scripts/workflows/seo-automation/performance-tracking.cjs`

### 2. **Fixed Workflow Character Issues**
Cleaned up corrupted characters in workflow echo statements:

**Before:**
```yaml
echo "� Running keyword database update..."
echo "�📊 Running full SEO analysis..."
```

**After:**
```yaml
echo "🔄 Running keyword database update..."
echo "📊 Running full SEO analysis..."
```

### 3. **Added Debug Capabilities**
Added comprehensive debugging step to workflow:

```yaml
- name: Debug file structure
  run: |
    echo "🔍 Debugging file structure..."
    echo "Current working directory: $(pwd)"
    echo "Contents of scripts/workflows/seo-automation/:"
    ls -la scripts/workflows/seo-automation/
    if [ -f "scripts/workflows/seo-automation/simple-seo-analysis.cjs" ]; then
      echo "✅ Target script exists"
    else
      echo "❌ Target script NOT found"
    fi
```

## 📊 **Expected Results:**

After these fixes, the next GitHub Actions run should:

1. ✅ **Find Scripts**: Debug step will confirm scripts exist in correct locations
2. ✅ **Load CSV Data**: Scripts will successfully find `scripts/data/seo-keywords.csv`
3. ✅ **Execute Successfully**: All SEO automation tasks should complete without errors
4. ✅ **Generate Reports**: Workflow will create reports in `scripts/reports/`

## 🎯 **Files Now Properly Configured:**

### **Workflow Paths (Correct):**
```yaml
node scripts/workflows/seo-automation/simple-seo-analysis.cjs      ✅
node scripts/workflows/seo-automation/seo-content-automation.cjs   ✅
node scripts/workflows/seo-automation/keyword-update.cjs           ✅
node scripts/workflows/seo-automation/performance-tracking.cjs     ✅
```

### **Script Data Paths (Environment-Aware):**
```javascript
// For GitHub Actions:
this.csvPath = 'scripts/data/seo-keywords.csv';         ✅

// For local development:
this.csvPath = '../../data/seo-keywords.csv';           ✅
```

### **Repository Structure (Clean):**
```
scripts/
├── data/
│   └── seo-keywords.csv                    # ✅ Tracked
├── reports/                                # ✅ Tracked
│   └── [workflow output files]
└── workflows/                              # ✅ Tracked
    └── seo-automation/
        ├── simple-seo-analysis.cjs         # ✅ Fixed paths
        ├── seo-content-automation.cjs      # ✅ Fixed paths
        ├── keyword-update.cjs              # ✅ Fixed paths
        └── performance-tracking.cjs        # ✅ Fixed paths
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Monitor Next Run**: Watch the GitHub Actions execution to see debug output
2. **Verify Success**: Confirm that scripts find their required files
3. **Remove Debug**: Once confirmed working, remove debug step for cleaner logs
4. **Test All Actions**: Verify all workflow action types work correctly

**Status**: 🔧 **FIXES APPLIED** - Waiting for next GitHub Actions run to confirm resolution  
**Confidence**: High - Addressed both potential root causes with comprehensive debugging  
**Next Run**: Should show debug output and execute successfully
